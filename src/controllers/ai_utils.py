# We've already created the pet365 Pinecone database and indexed our documents.
# Pinecone is a cloud-based vector database service that allows us to store and query our documents.
# Importantly, we have split our documents into 1000 character chunks and indexed them separately.
# This overcomes the context window limitation of LLMs and allows for more accurate and relevant responses.
# The more data we feed into the LLM with our query, the less accurate (and more expensive) the responses become.
# Chunking allows us to provide only the most relevant information to the LLM.

# First we initialize Pinecone, set the index name and the embedding model.
# Think of this as simply connecting to the database for content retrieval.
# We set the embedding model to OpenAI because that's what we used when we indexed our documents.
# The embedding model is used to create an embedding of the query, which is a numerical (graph-based) representation of the query.
# It's important to use the same embedding model that we used when we indexed our documents, so that the query embedding can be accurately compared to the document embeddings in the vector store.

# The query function is the core of our conversational system.
# It processes user queries, retrieves relevant information from the vector database, and generates responses.
# This function:
# 1. Vectorizes the user's question
# 2. Performs a similarity search in the vector database to find the 5 most relevant documents
# 3. Sends the user's question and the retrieved documents to the LLM for processing
# 4. Generates an answer based on the retrieved documents
# 5. Adds the user's question and the generated answer to the session history
# 6. Streams the generated response back to the user

# If a follow-up question is asked, the function:
# 1. Sends the follow-up question and the chat history to the LLM for processing into a standalone question
# 2. Generates a contextualised follow-up question that does not need the chat history as context
# 3. Performs a similarity search using the new question to find the 5 most relevant documents
# 4. Sends the new question and the retrieved documents to the LLM for processing
# 5. Generates an answer based on the retrieved documents
# 6. Adds the follow-up question and the generated answer to the session history
# 7. Streams the generated response back to the user
