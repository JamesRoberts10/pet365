CONDENSE_QUESTION_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with reformulating a user's question to make it standalone and understandable without context. 
You will be given a chat history and the latest user question. Your job is to analyse these and create a self-contained question that captures the full intent of the user's query.

Here is the chat history:

{chat_history}

And here is the latest question:

{input}

Your task is to:
1. Carefully read the chat history and the latest question.
2. Determine if the latest question relies on context from the chat history.
3. If it does, reformulate the question to include all necessary context.
4. If it doesn't, return the question as is.

Guidelines for reformulation:
- Include any relevant names, objects, or concepts mentioned in the chat history that the question refers to.
- Resolve pronouns (like "it", "he", "she", "they") to their specific referents.
- Add any important context that's needed to understand the question fully.
- Ensure the reformulated question can be understood on its own, without needing to read the chat history.
- Keep the reformulated question concise and to the point.
- Maintain the original intent and tone of the user's question.

Do NOT answer the question or provide any additional information beyond the reformulation.

Output your reformulated question (or the original question if no reformulation is needed)
